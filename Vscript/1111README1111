This folder contains a number of vscript files, NOT ALL OF THEM ARE NEEDED.

The majority of these will be packed in the maps that use them, some of them can optionally be used on any map but only with admin commands.

The necessary main file which these all build upon is mga_script.nut. This should be packed in every mga map.

Description of other files use cases:
    mga_conc - Handles conc gamemode, this only work if enabled in a config by an admin, or if set to an arena with an admin command. This should only be packed in mga maps which contain an arena named 'conc'

    mga_demo - This is an optional extension on the main script designed to make DemoGA a thing, it is experimental and can either be packed into a map file along with a map specific config to tell the main script to run it, or it can be ran on the server console by the server operator.

    mga_duelrank - This was designed specifically for our official mga rewrite servers, it links vscript to a sourcemod in order to send duel results to a discord channel, this should never be used unless you are setting up a server and use our own custom discord relaying plugin.

    mga_tanktaunt - Optional addition script to allow anyone to use the tank taunt with m/tank, tank taunts now also fire rockets, and can instakill other players who are also in a tank. You can pack this in your map if you want, but its almost certainly something that a server operator should manage, by modifying their server config to tell the main  script to run this one.

    mga_helpwarn - This is optional for servers that also use sourcemods, it alerts player to the alternate prefix for the vscript chat commands.

    mga_modeduels - This handles jugg and conc duels for the mga_offcuts map. ONLY INCLUDE IT ALONGSIDE mga_conc.nut, even if you only want a juggduel, it requires the conc script.

    mga_skoth - Script which handles speedykoth mga maps, this will be explained in a new separate prefab map in the future as it requires map entities to work.

    mga_utrl - This is an experimental addon, turning the beggars bazooka into a semi-faithful remake of the ut99 rocket launcher, same deal as the tank script above. But even less desirable for a server operator to enable as its very unbalanced.

    powertest - This is for a secret on mga_bootcamp, only bother including this file in your server or personal tf folder if you are running the NOSCRIPT mga_bootcamp_..._NoSc map file.

_________________NOW THE BHOPUI_________________
This entire folder structure should ONLY EVER BE PACKED INSIDE THE MAP.
This is because the vscript file requires the models and textures for the bhop style ui.
A map maker must pack both, otherwise issues occur, and running this on a server with a map that does not pack the needed assets will cause severe issues.
