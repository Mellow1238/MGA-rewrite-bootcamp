Map source files for map makers to dig around in and copy elements out of. Feel free to use these for anything, but preferably add Mellow to the credits.

The map sources for ported maps WILL NOT be included, as I only have permission to port them, not share their source publically. Also majority of them were decompiled then ported meaning the sources are far far messier than an original map source shared by the original developer.
